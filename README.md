This package is a malicious file that allows users to download the old version of vsftp without the user's knowledge. 
If a user makes a typo when trying to install Jupyter Notebook via pip and runs pip, this file will be downloaded.
This is a test package for research, and the corresponding vsftp is built to open a backdoor, so please do not download it.
